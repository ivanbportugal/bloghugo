      <description>Intro After getting introduced to Go, I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen in love&amp;hellip; Without making this corny, I really wanted to explore what the platform/language can do immediately. I&amp;rsquo;m sorta done with Hello World projects and going through examples of the language so I&amp;rsquo;d like to present a more-or-less real-world example.
Technologies used: - Go - Martini - Nodejs - Grunt - Bower
Pseudo real-world Go Project
Why Nodejs too? I love web technologies.</description>

      <description>Well it looks like I keep starting new blogs over and over again but really I’m just playing around with what I think is neat. Since I love web technologies, fiddling around with Ghost, Medium, and other “cutting edge” blog platforms is really just a matter of self-discovery. I think I’ve settled on HUGO for the long term but we will see if someone comes up with something truly revolutionary in the future that will force me to reconsider.</description>
