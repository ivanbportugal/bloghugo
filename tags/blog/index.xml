      <description>Well it looks like I keep starting new blogs over and over again but really I’m just playing around with what I think is neat. Since I love web technologies, fiddling around with Ghost, Medium, and other “cutting edge” blog platforms is really just a matter of self-discovery. I think I’ve settled on HUGO for the long term but we will see if someone comes up with something truly revolutionary in the future that will force me to reconsider.</description>
