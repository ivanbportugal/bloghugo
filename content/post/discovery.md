Well it looks like I keep starting new blogs over and over again but really I’m just playing around with what I think is neat. Since I love web technologies, fiddling around with Ghost, Medium, and other “cutting edge” blog platforms is really just a matter of self-discovery. I think I’ve settled on [HUGO](http://gohugo.io/) for the long term but we will see if someone comes up with something truly revolutionary in the future that will force me to reconsider.

Not that it’s even a big deal anyways since the content of this site/blog is what actually matters...

I intend to have random client-side projects linked to this in the future
